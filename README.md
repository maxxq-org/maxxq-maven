# MavenDependencyResolver

Resolve maven dependencies programmatically through simple to use Java classes.

## Getting started

Add maven dependency:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.maxxq.maven</groupId>
        <artifactId>maxxq-maven</artifactId>
        <version>1.3.3</version>
    </dependency>

## Resolving dependencies

### For single pom from maven central

    Set<Dependency> resolvedDependencies = new ResolveDependencies(new RemoteRepository( "https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/" ))
                                           .getDependencies(new GAV("com.squareup.okhttp3", "okhttp", "4.9.3"));

### For single pom provided as InputStream

    Set<Dependency> resolvedDependencies = new ResolveDependencies(new RemoteRepository( "https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/" )))
                                           .getDependencies(InputStream pomStream)

### For reactor build with pom's provided as input streams

   
	 Set<Dependency> resolvedDependencies = new ResolveDependencies(new RemoteRepository( "https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/" )))
                                           .getDependencies(InputStream pomStream1, InputStream pomStream2, ...)
                                           
                                           
### For specific modules of reactor build with pom's provided as input streams

     ResolveDependencies resolveDependencies = new ResolveDependencies(new RemoteRepository( "https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/" )))
	  GAV parent = resolveDependencies.store(getClass().getResourceAsStream("/parent/pom.xml"));
     GAV module1 = resolveDependencies.store(getClass().getResourceAsStream("/module1/pom.xml"));
     GAV module2 = resolveDependencies.store(getClass().getResourceAsStream("/module2/pom.xml"));

     Set<Dependency> dependencies = resolveDependencies.getDependencies(module1, module2);
                                       
### Advanced config for repositories

	ResolveDependencies resolveDependencies = new ResolveDependencies(
            new VirtualRepository()
                    .addRepository(new LocalInMemoryRepository()) //at least 1 repo is required to which writing is possible for storage of the reactor pom's
                    .addRepository(new InMemoryCachingRepository(new FileCachingRepository(Paths.get("c:/data/pomcache/"), new RemoteRepository(RemoteRepository.MAVEN_CENTRAL))))); 
    resolveDependencies.getDependencies(InputStream pomStream)
    
### Using custom request builder

A custom request builder can be given to RemoteRepository to craft request with the specific authentication that might be required for private repositories

	new RemoteRepository(RemoteRepository.MAVEN_CENTRAL, customRequestBuilder)


### Resolver Logic

- Traverse parent pom's: copy properties, dependencies and dependency management dependencies if not already existing
- Resolve properties in dependency management 
- Recursively follow pom includes in dependency management
- Apply dependency management on existing dependencies (not on the transitive ones, these are not yet loaded)
- Obtain transitive dependencies recursively. Do not replace existing dependencies (shortest path rule & in case of conflict take the first one) 
- Reapply dependency management on existing dependencies only for the root pom [dependency management is not transitive](src/main/resources/dependencymanagementisnottransitive/readme.md)

## Calculating an effective pom

### For single pom from maven central

    Model resolvedModel = new ResolveBuildConfiguration(new RemoteRepository( "https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/" ))
                                           .resolveBuildConfiguration(new GAV("com.squareup.okhttp3", "okhttp", "4.9.3"));

Same logic applies as for ResolveDependencies for loading pom from other input sources and for multi module projects.

## Local Deployment
snapshot: mvn deploy -DaltDeploymentRepository=ossrh::default::https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots
release:  mvn deploy -DaltDeploymentRepository=ossrh::default::https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/service/local/staging/deploy/maven2

## Deployment with github action
https://github.com/marketplace/actions/action-maven-publish

### create release version
	git checkout release/[1-9] 1-9: major version of the release
	git reset --hard master	      : reset to the last version for which a release needs to be created
	mvn versions:set              : set the version to the desired release version
	git push --force	      : force the release branch to this version containing the release version

github action [worfklow for code quality](.github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml) will be triggered after which 
github action [workflow for release version](.github/workflows/maven-publish-release-sonatype.yml) for publishing the release is executed

after successfull execution the release version is uploaded to sonatype where a manual approval will result in a final publishing of the jar.
Go to [https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories](https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories) and login with your crendentials.  Find the jar ready for publication and either choose 'close' to finalize the publication or 'reject' to discard the release version.  [https://central.sonatype.org/publish/release/#locate-and-examine-your-staging-repository](sonatype publish staged artifacts)

After closing the artifact is available on [https://search.maven.org/](https://search.maven.org/) but not yet on [https://mvnrepository.com/repos/central](https://mvnrepository.com/repos/central), to be analysed.

### create snapshot version
After publishing to master the [workflow for snapshot version](.github/workflows/maven-publish-snapshot-sonatype.yml) will be triggered which will automatically publish the snapshot version, which is made available on https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots
